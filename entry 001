ogre's den is essentially my thoughts, on the internet. as best as i can transcribe them.

a thought bouncing between the walls of my mind is nostalgia. recently, nostalgia has been a constant in my life. whether its music, friends, or old video games i played as a young'un, nostalgia is there. a yearning for the past. i'm not too sure what sparked this, honestly. my most regular meal for nostalgia has been Sitekick Remastered. an effort put forth by similar; some folk bit by nostalgia but with more smarts and dedication. it is a remaster/remake of the early 2000s online website game called Sitekick, by YTV. i have so many memories playing this game clouded with age. it was a great time. but i also don't remember it clearly. regardless, the remaster is a beautiful creation and i am very glad to have had remembered its existence. 

an aspect of nostalgia that i find interesting is the mind's ability to entirely neglect the negative aspects of certain memories. there are these specific 3D images created by either a reddit or twitter user that hooked me. i stared at them for some time on a particular morning on which i was awake earlier than normal. see below:
